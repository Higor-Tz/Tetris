Tetris is a game that consists of a 10x20 board where pieces of the tetramino type will be stacked (four identical squares, arranged according to the rule of poliminós), they will fall into the board, when a line of blocks is completed this line disappears, with all blocks above this line going down one level.

Each completed line is scored 50 points, if two are completed at the same time the point value obtained for each completed line is doubled, if there are three lines, the previous score is quadrupled and if four lines are filled at once with the piece “ I ”, the total the score 3200 points is added, in other words, four times the previous score.
